# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves updating the visual identity of the FlowHook Chat App to use a new brand color palette. The current application uses a generic indigo-based color scheme that needs to be replaced with a specific brand palette consisting of blues, reds, yellow, and white. The update should maintain the current functionality while refreshing the visual appearance to align with the new brand identity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat application to reflect the new brand colors, so that the interface feels consistent with the updated brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the header SHALL use BLUE YONDER (#2E96F5) as the primary background color
2. WHEN displaying the robot avatar THEN the system SHALL use ELECTRIC BLUE (#0042A6) for the avatar background
3. WHEN showing user messages THEN the system SHALL use NEON BLUE (#0960E1) for the message background
4. WHEN displaying system messages THEN the system SHALL use a light variant of BLUE YONDER for the message background
5. WHEN showing interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use appropriate colors from the brand palette

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want accent colors and highlights to use the brand palette, so that the entire interface feels cohesive and branded.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN hovering over interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use DEEP BLUE (#07173F) for hover states
2. WHEN displaying focus states on inputs THEN the system SHALL use NEON BLUE (#0960E1) for the focus ring
3. WHEN showing the send button THEN the system SHALL use ELECTRIC BLUE (#0042A6) as the background
4. WHEN displaying the typing indicator dots THEN the system SHALL use DEEP BLUE (#07173F) for the dot colors
5. WHEN showing timestamps and secondary text THEN the system SHALL maintain readability with appropriate contrast

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the scrollbar and other UI elements to match the new color scheme, so that no element feels out of place with the new brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through messages THEN the scrollbar SHALL use colors from the brand palette
2. WHEN viewing the clear chat button THEN it SHALL use appropriate brand colors for normal and hover states
3. WHEN displaying borders and dividers THEN they SHALL use subtle variations of the brand colors
4. WHEN showing the connection status indicator THEN it SHALL use brand-appropriate colors
5. WHEN displaying any error or success states THEN they SHALL incorporate ROCKET RED (#E43700) or NEON YELLOW (#EAFE07) as appropriate

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the color implementation to be maintainable and consistent, so that future updates can be made efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing colors THEN the system SHALL use CSS custom properties for brand colors
2. WHEN defining color variants THEN the system SHALL create logical groupings (primary, secondary, accent)
3. WHEN applying colors THEN the system SHALL maintain WCAG accessibility contrast requirements
4. WHEN updating Tailwind classes THEN the system SHALL use consistent color naming conventions
5. WHEN defining hover and focus states THEN they SHALL follow a predictable pattern across all interactive elements
