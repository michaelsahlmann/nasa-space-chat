# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issues in a web-based chat application that communicates with a webhook endpoint. The current implementation fails due to browser security policies blocking cross-origin requests. The solution will provide multiple approaches to handle CORS restrictions while maintaining a smooth user experience and proper error handling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the chat application, I want to send messages without encountering CORS errors, so that I can have uninterrupted conversations with the webhook service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a message THEN the system SHALL successfully send the request to the webhook endpoint without CORS errors
2. WHEN the webhook endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN a request fails due to network issues THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback and retry options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want multiple CORS handling strategies implemented, so that the application can work in different deployment scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying locally THEN the system SHALL provide a proxy server solution to bypass CORS restrictions
2. WHEN the webhook server supports CORS THEN the system SHALL handle preflight requests properly
3. WHEN CORS cannot be resolved THEN the system SHALL provide fallback mechanisms for message handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when the chat service is experiencing connectivity issues, so that I understand what's happening and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a request is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a typing indicator
2. WHEN a request fails THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the issue
3. WHEN the service is offline THEN the system SHALL indicate the connection status and suggest retry actions
4. WHEN messages are queued due to connectivity issues THEN the system SHALL attempt to resend them when connection is restored

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor the application's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information to the console
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL capture and display the specific error type
3. WHEN debugging is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide verbose logging of all network operations
4. WHEN errors are user-facing THEN the system SHALL provide actionable guidance for resolution
